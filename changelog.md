## v1.3.1 - 2025-11-11

- Suggest last loaded build name when saving
  - Remember the most recently loaded build's name and prefill it as a suggestion when opening the Save Build modal.

- Require both skills and items before build actions
  - Validation logic updated: the "buildRequired" error is shown only when both skills and items are empty, reducing false positives.

- Add sorting to saved builds in Load Build modal
  - Users can sort saved builds by Name or Date in ascending/descending order; UI controls were added to the Load Build modal.

- Add manual drag-and-drop reordering for saved builds
  - Introduced a "Manual" sort mode and a drag-handle for reordering saved builds. The custom order is persisted to localStorage and the UI shows feedback during drag operations.
